# Capes
Repository of Sol Client capes. Currently given to players who suggest features.

## Capes file
```
{"player":"cape file"}
```

This file contains a map of player to a cape file. This isn't ideal, but any kind of proper cape system requires server hosting, and server hosting requires money, and I don't want to charge people for a digital lego client.
